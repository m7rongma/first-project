        <p>John was always interested in computers and technology from a young age. He would spend hours tinkering with old computers and software, trying to figure out how they worked. When he finished high school, he decided to pursue his passion and enrolled in a computer science program at a local university.</p>
        <p>After graduating, John started his career as a web developer, eager to put his skills to the test. He landed a job at a small web development agency, where he worked long hours, often staying late into the night to complete projects on time.</p>
